ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest AWS Automation Project! ðŸš€

Over the past few weeks, I've been working on a set of scripts using Boto3 to streamline and automate various AWS operations. This project covers a range of AWS services, making cloud management more efficient and less time-consuming.

Here's what I've been working on:

EC2: Automate instance management, start/stop instances, and more.
DynamoDB: Automate table creation, data manipulation, and backups.
IAM: Manage user roles, policies, and permissions.
RDS: Automate database instance management and backups.
S3: Handle bucket creation, object uploads/downloads, and lifecycle policies.
VPC: Manage VPC creation, subnets, security groups, and more.
Each script is well-documented, easy to use, and includes a menu-driven interface for simplifying repetitive tasks. Iâ€™ve also created a comprehensive GitHub repository where you can explore and contribute to these scripts.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or contribute to the project. Your insights are always appreciated!
