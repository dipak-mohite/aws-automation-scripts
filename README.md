# 🚀 Excited to Share My Latest AWS Automation Project! 🚀

Over the past few weeks, I've been working on a set of scripts using **Boto3** to streamline and automate various AWS operations. This project covers a range of AWS services, making cloud management more efficient and less time-consuming.

## What I've Been Working On:

### 🌐 EC2
- Automate instance management
- Start/stop instances
- And more...

### 📊 DynamoDB
- Automate table creation
- Data manipulation
- Backups

### 🔒 IAM
- Manage user roles
- Policies and permissions

### 🗃️ RDS
- Automate database instance management
- Backups

### ☁️ S3
- Handle bucket creation
- Object uploads/downloads
- Lifecycle policies

### 🏗️ VPC
- Manage VPC creation
- Subnets
- Security groups
- And more...

Each script is well-documented, easy to use, and includes a menu-driven interface for simplifying repetitive tasks.
